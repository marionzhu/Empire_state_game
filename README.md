Hacker Statistics - Empire State Games

You throw a dice 100 times

- If you get 1 or 2, you go one step down
- If you get 3, 4 or 5, you go one step up
- If you get 6, you will throw the dice again and will walk up the resulting number
- You cannot go lower than step 0
- You have 0.1% chance of falling down the stairs and move from 0 again

When you reach 60 steps high or more, then you win the game, otherwise lose. What is the chance of winning the game?
